<h2>What's this?</h2>
<p>This is the internet version of the pen and paper “Who am I?” game. You won’t need pen and paper here!</p>
<h2>What do I need to play?</h2>
<p>You will need a few real life friends with phones or computers at them :)</p>
<h2>How do we play?</h2>
<p>First thing’s first, write your name in the “Your name” box. Doh!</p>
<p>Then write a role for another person in the “Role for another person” box. The role can be anything, from people you know, celebrities, cartoons, movie characters, historical figures, etc. Try to think of a role that is known by all the people in the group, but at the same time is not an easy guess. Every player will do the same, and after the game is started the roles will be randomly assigned to everyone in the group.</p>
<p>Then, click/tap the “Play” button.</p>
<h2>Then what?</h2>
<p>You are now in the lobby, where you can see the players that have completed the previous step. After everyone has joined the lobby, one person from the group may click/tap the” Start Game” button. </p>
<p>Now every role is assigned randomly to each player. You can see the names and corresponding roles for everyone, *except yourself*. This is where the fun begins: everyone must guess who they are, as the title of the game suggests!  You take turns, asking the other players questions about your character. The questions must be *yes or no* questions. “Am I a girl?” is a good question, while “Am I male or female?” is not. You can ask one question at a time, then the next player (to your left) asks their question, and so on. If you have a hint of who you might be, you take a guess on your turn, asking for example, “Am I Superman?”.</p>
<h3>If you guess your role, you win the game!</h3>
<p><i>You cannot win the game on another player’s turn or by asking a second question on your turn.</i></p>
<p>If you figured it out. you must be patient until it is your turn again. The first person to guess who they are wins the game! Then you can just tap “End Game” and go again. Why wouldn’t you, it’s so much fun!</p>
<h2>TLDR</h2>
<p>Type your name and a role for another player, tap “play”, wait for everyone to join the lobby, one player must tap “start game”; you don’t know your role but you know everyone else’s, try to guess yours, ask a yes/no question about your character, only one per turn, person to your left asks a yes/no question about their character, and so on;  first person to guess who they are, during their turn, wins the game, have fun!</p>
