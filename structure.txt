	Algorithm:
: Notice player that the map is 1 month/1 month-ish travel time
o Generate a green background
o Generate water (uninhabited)
	- Generate 0 or 1 (or rarely 2) large patches of water
		- Also, see if it starts from a side
	- These "patches of water" (blue)
		- These tree from eachother with a chance not to span
		- It also stop spanning from a point on
o Generate cities with pseudorandom positions
	- if too close to eachother, try other pos
	- if it is on water, give it like 1/5 chance to stay there
		if this happens, mark it as an Island city to generate 
	- make sure you only repeat like 30 times so it doesnt get stuck
	- all (almost) cities have a NULL terrain type (isl
o For each city, parse and generate its quest locations or some shit
o Generate terrain:
	- so until now, we should have a map with water and grass and random cities around
	- Generate random mountains
		- mountains are generated similar to water:
			- choose 1 starting spot
			- span from there
				- for each span, check that it's not on water
			- fewer trees
		- forests
			- same as mountains, but for each span, check adjacent
